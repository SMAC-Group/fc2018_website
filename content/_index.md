# Forecasting

> Plan for the future because that's where you are going to spend the rest of your life.
> <cite> Mark Twain </cite>

The objective of the website is to provide support for the *Forecasting* class given at the Faculty of Business and Economics (HEC Lausanne) of the University of Lausanne in Fall 2018. This course capitalizes on the knowledge acquired in the [Time Series and Forecasting](https://hec.unil.ch/hec/syllabus/descriptif/2286) class taught in Spring 2018. The students will not only learn different forecasting methods but also how to assess and combine them. The accent is made on practical situations and students will face live forecasting experiences. Upon the completion of this course, students will have an overview of the methodologies that can be employed for forecasting as well as a strong sense on how to interactively apply them to different problems while keeping track of the progress by documenting and making reports.
