### Laptops
Bring a laptop to the class every week if you have one. We encourage students to work collaboratively, so we would like to have at least one laptop for every 2 or 3 students. Since the forecasting competition is the work of a team, we encourage you to team-up with students that possess a laptop. In the case you plan to buy a laptop, remember that the students from Swiss Universities have preferential prices via the [Neptun Projekt](https://www.projektneptun.ch/) or the [EPFL's Poseidon](https://poseidon.epfl.ch/).

You do not need to buy a laptop if you do not possess one.

### Textbooks
Most of this class is based on the online textbook:

- **Required**: [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.org/fpp2/) by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos

Other useful references are at the [resources page](https://fc2018.netlify.com/resources/).

### Software
All the software we will be using are free for acamedic activities. The course will use the [R statistical computing language](https://www.r-project.org/). The integrated developer environment that we will use to explore R is [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) made by [RStudio Inc](https://www.rstudio.com/).
